  + ptr_unordered_multimap
  + ptr_unordered_multiset
  + ptr_unordered_set
  + ptr_vector
* Smart Ptr
  + scoped_ptr
  + shared_ptr
  + weak_ptr
* Unordered
  + unordered_map
  + unordered_multimap
  + unordered_multiset
  + unordered_set

== How to build ==
./autogen.sh # if you are building from git
./configure
make
make install

== How to use ==
Because these pretty printers are for header-only Boost libraries, it is
not possible to use auto-loading. That means you need to import the
pretty printers manually. You can use the code in boost-gdb-printers.py
(under any license you need).

== License ==
The project is released under GPLv3.
